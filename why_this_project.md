## Why are you applying to this project?
I am applying to this project because it aligns perfectly with my passion for the intersection of art, AI, and motion analysis. My experience in skeleton-based motion capture, robotics, and deep learning has given me a strong technical foundation, and I am eager to explore how AI can be leveraged to model, classify, and generate expressive movements. I am particularly interested in multimodal representations of dance and how AI can enhance choreography, motion synthesis, and artistic expression.
Additionally, I see this project as an opportunity to contribute meaningful research that blends machine learning, computer vision, and creative arts, an area that is rapidly evolving and has immense potential for applications in virtual reality, animation, and human-computer interaction.

## Do you have any artistic background or creative hobbies?
Yes, I do. I play the guitar, which has given me an appreciation for rhythm, timing, and expression—elements that are also crucial in dance. Music and movement are deeply interconnected, and my understanding of musical structure helps me relate to the patterns and sequences in dance.
While my background is primarily technical, I have always been fascinated by movement, animation, and biomechanics. My work in robotics and motion planning involves designing systems that replicate human motion, which requires an appreciation for fluid movement and creativity. I also enjoy exploring data visualization, which is an artistic endeavor in itself, as it requires crafting intuitive and aesthetically meaningful representations of complex datasets.

## Do you have any particular experience with the intersection of AI and art?
No, this was my first time exploring the intersection of AI and art. While I have worked with machine learning and motion analysis, I hadn’t specifically applied it to creative fields like dance before. However, through this project, I became interested in how AI can interpret, classify, and generate movement, and I’m excited to explore this further.

## What are some of the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating AI into the creative process?
### Benefits:
* AI can augment creativity by generating novel motion sequences that humans might not think of, inspiring new choreography.

* It enables efficient animation and motion synthesis, reducing the time needed to create lifelike movement for virtual characters.

* AI can analyze and extract features from dance movements, allowing for data-driven choreography insights and cross-cultural dance comparisons.

### Drawbacks:
* AI-generated movements may lack the emotional depth and nuance that human dancers bring to their performances.

* There is a risk of homogenization, where AI tends to generate repetitive patterns based on training data, limiting diversity in creative expression.

* The reliance on AI tools might reduce the role of human choreographers, shifting control away from artists and toward algorithms.

## How do you like to collaborate on research projects?
I enjoy a balance of independent work and collaboration. I prefer:

* Collaborative brainstorming sessions to align on goals and discuss ideas.

* Asynchronous work with structured check-ins, ensuring flexibility while maintaining progress.

* Text-based communication (Slack, Discord, Email) for discussions, with occasional real-time meetings for major decisions.

* Version control and shared documentation (e.g., GitHub, Notion) for organized collaboration.

## Do you have any particular ideas you’d be excited to try on the subject of multimodal representations of dance?
* Clustering and Generating Dance Phrases: Using autoencoders or transformers to group similar motion patterns and generate smooth transitions between dance phrases.

* Personalized AI Choreography Assistant: Developing an AI that adapts to an individual dancer’s style, creating custom movement sequences based on their unique motion tendencies.

* Cross-Cultural Motion Analysis: Training AI models on diverse dance styles to analyze and compare different movement traditions, potentially uncovering hidden connections between dance forms.

## (Optional) Anything else you’d like us to know?
I am highly motivated to contribute to this project, not only from a technical perspective but also from a human-centered AI approach. I believe that AI should enhance artistic expression rather than replace it, and I am eager to explore ways to make AI an intuitive and useful tool for choreographers and dancers.
